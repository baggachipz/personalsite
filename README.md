# My Personal Site

Oh look, you've found my 'hire me!' site source. It's pretty simple really; I used [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) to create the page scaffolding and filled it with contents. This allowed me to quickly and efficiently develop a one-page site which is:

* Relatively attractive
* Fast, compressed, and minified
* Uses latest web dev technologies like ES6, Vue, CSS3, Stylus, Webpack, and Babel
* Shows that I'm capable of at least using a framework to build a site

Yes, I know it's a bit much to create one single page, but I also wanted to show that I know how to do this sort of thing. Normally, I wouldn't bring a bazooka when a knife is necessary.

I have coupled this with static site hosting on [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) in order to bring this to you with automatic continuous deployment on a free (as in beer), distributed, and secure content delivery network. We live in the future!
